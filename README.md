## üöÄ Getting Started (Local Development)

To run DreamCraft on your local machine for development purposes, follow these steps:

**1. Prerequisites:**
*   Node.js (v18 or later)
*   npm or yarn

**2. Set Up Environment Variables:**
*   Create a new file named `.env.local` in the root of the project.
*   Add your Gemini API key to this file. The `VITE_` prefix is required by Vite.
    ```
    VITE_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

**3. Install and Run:**
You can use the provided Makefile for convenience.
```bash
# Install dependencies
make install

# Run the development server
make dev
```
The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## üê≥ Docker & Deployment

For a consistent and portable experience, DreamCraft is fully containerized. You can build and run the application with a single command, which is the recommended way for production or easy setup.

**1. Prerequisites:**
*   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed and running.

**2. Build the Docker Image:**
Use the Makefile to run the build script. This creates a production-optimized container image named `dreamcraft`.
```bash
make docker-build
```

**3. Run the Docker Container:**
This command starts the container and makes the application available on port 8080. It securely passes your API key as a runtime environment variable.
```bash
# IMPORTANT: Replace YOUR_API_KEY_HERE with your actual Gemini API key
make docker-run API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```
Now, open your browser and navigate to **`http://localhost:8080`**.

**4. Manage the Container:**
The Makefile includes commands to manage the container's lifecycle.
```bash
# Stop the running container
make docker-stop

# View logs from the running container
make docker-logs
```

### Advanced: Running as a Systemd Service

For deploying DreamCraft as a persistent service on a Linux server, you can use the provided `dreamcraft.service` file as a template.

1.  **Create an Environment File**: On your server, create a file to store your API key securely.
    ```bash
    sudo mkdir -p /etc/dreamcraft
    echo "API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" | sudo tee /etc/dreamcraft/environment
    sudo chmod 600 /etc/dreamcraft/environment # Secure the file
    ```
2.  **Move and Configure the Service File**:
    *   Copy the `dreamcraft.service` file to `/etc/systemd/system/`.
    *   Make sure the `ExecStart` command in the service file correctly points to your user and the container name (`dreamcraft`).
3.  **Enable and Start the Service**:
    ```bash
    # Reload systemd to recognize the new service
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload

    # Enable the service to start on boot
    sudo systemctl enable dreamcraft.service

    # Start the service immediately
    sudo systemctl start dreamcraft.service

    # Check the status
    sudo systemctl status dreamcraft.service
    ```
The application will now be running and will automatically restart if the server reboots.
